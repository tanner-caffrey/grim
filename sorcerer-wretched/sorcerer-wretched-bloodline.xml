            <p>With every promise made to a fairy, contract signed with a devil, and pact with the
                unquiet dead, there's a chance someone doesn't keep their end of the bargain. The
                vengeance of immortal beings lasts much longer than one lifetime, and the lingering
                magic of these curses can affect the mortal's descendants.</p>
            <p>These inherited magical afflictions may manifest as a plague, deformity, or aversion
                to the sun. In such families, a child may be born that learns to master the latent
                magic within their inherited curse, turning their bloodline's bane into a personal
                boonâ€”these sorcerers are known collectively as the Wretched.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you have mastered the ability to temporarily cast a small
                fragment of your curse onto another. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature
                you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature has disadvantage on the next ability
                check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once you use this feature, you can't
                do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point
                to use it again.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, your senses easily attune to the supernatural forces that caused your
                inherited affliction. You know the detect evil and good spell and can cast it
                without expending a spell slot. This spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you but
                does not count against your number of spells known. Once you cast this spell without
                expending a spell slot, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p>In addition, choose one of the following creature types as the being who cursed your
                ancestor: fey, fiend, or undead. While you are concentrating on the detect evil and
                good spell, creatures of the chosen type have disadvantage on attack rolls against
                you, and you cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.</p>

            <p>Also at 1st level, you suffer from a curse inherited from an ancestor who failed to
                uphold their end of a bargain with an otherworldly power. Choose one of the
                following curses that was passed down to you.</p>
            <p><b>Hulking:</b> Your ancestor was cursed with a hulking frame. You have disadvantage
                on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks made to move quietly. In addition, your
                maximum hit points increase by 1 and increase by 1 again each time you gain a level
                in this class. Finally, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying
                capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
            <p><b>Nocturnal:</b> Your ancestor was cursed to shun the light of day. You have
                disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) ability checks made to see while you are in
                sunlight. In addition, you have darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet and can see
                through magical darkness within that range.</p>
            <p><b>Plaguebearer:</b> Your ancestor was cursed with physical symptoms of a plague. You
                have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) ability checks made against humanoid
                creatures who are not blinded. In addition, you are immune to disease and have
                resistance to necrotic damage.</p>

            <p>At 6th level, you learn the bestow curse spell. This spell counts as a sorcerer spell
                for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. When you
                cast the spell, you can choose to cast it by spending 5 sorcery points instead of a
                spell slot. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, its range changes to 60 feet
                for that casting and your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking
                damage.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to adopt the terrifying visage of
                the being who cursed your ancestor for 10 minutes. During this time, you can use an
                action on each of your turns to cause each creature who can see you within 30 feet
                make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failure, a
                creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p>In addition, while you have adopted the terrifying visage, you gain an additional
                benefit based on the creature type chosen with your Blood Ties feature.</p>
            <p><b>Fey:</b> You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet in any direction.</p>
            <p><b>Fiend:</b> You have resistance to cold and fire damage.</p>
            <p><b>Undead:</b> When you take damage that isn't radiant, you can use your reaction to
                reduce that damage by an amount equal to half your sorcerer level.</p>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 18th level, your magic has become powerful enough that you can call and
                command a servant of those that cursed you. Choose one of the following creatures as
                a representative for your curse based on the choice you made with your Blood Ties
                feature: lamia or troll (fey only), barbed devil or incubus/succubus (fiend only),
                ghost or wraith (undead only).</p>
            <p>You can use an action and spend 5 sorcery points to summon your chosen creature. The
                creature appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet, and disappears
                when it drops to 0 hit points, you use this feature to summon another creature, or
                after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
            <p>Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on
                each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no
                action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no
                command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach.</p>

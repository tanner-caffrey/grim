            <p>With every promise made to a fairy, contract signed with a devil, and pact with the
                unquiet dead, there's a chance someone doesn't keep their end of the bargain. The
                vengeance of immortal beings lasts much longer than one lifetime, and the lingering
                magic of these curses can affect the mortal's descendants.</p>
            <p>These inherited magical afflictions may manifest as a plague, deformity, or aversion
                to the sun. In such families, a child may be born that learns to master the latent
                magic within their inherited curse, turning their bloodline's bane into a personal
                boonâ€”these sorcerers are known collectively as the Wretched.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you have mastered the ability to temporarily cast a small
                fragment of your curse onto another. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature
                you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature has disadvantage on the next ability
                check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once you use this feature, you can't
                do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point
                to use it again.</p>
